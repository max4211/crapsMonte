In preparation of a casino visit in Europe, I would like to simulate various strategies and explore the results.

## Goals
The main goal of this repository is determine optimal strategies for various betting schemes in the craps dice casino game.

### Steps
This will be accomplished through gameplay backend construction and optimization, then using AI to learn the best strategy, then develop a GUI to make it pretty for the user.

1. Create the game (pure console development)
    1. Correctly implement rules. Try to maintain dynamic strucutre to allow efficient implementataion of subsequent steps
2. Develop GUI of what is going on under the hood
    1. Aid with visualization of various turns
    2. Good practice of front end development
3. Run Monte Carlo analytics on various strategies under following conditions (this list is dynamic)
    1. Limited bankroll
    2. Limited time
    3. Various known payout structures
    4. Loaded dice
4. Verify Monte Carlo simulation runs with statistical probabilities (this is a lot less fun)
